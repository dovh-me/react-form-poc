-   We should be able to intercept the requests
-   Because the backend might need a different format from the input component format

-   We should be able to load values from the response
-   Including validation results or whatever
-   We should be able to render elements using a schema
-   There are certain fields which are dynamic while some are static

-   Static fields might have complex frontend validations
-   Dynamic fields may have some value constraints like min, max, minLength, etc.
